# outward demo
This is an Outward demo to demonstrate the required coding challenges.  

In any other case I would have chosen to use a more structural rendering framework technology like React or Angular.  Due to the requirements I chose to use a more traditional methodology and used the following UI stack.
- Express server
- Handlebars templating engine
- Bootstrap 3.x
- And good old JQuery

## Install

**node.js**:

Once downloaded or cloned, run the following commands to install and start the application.  The application will listen on port 9000.  This can be changed to meet your needs in the config.js file.

```bash
npm install

node app

or 

nodemon app.js
```
